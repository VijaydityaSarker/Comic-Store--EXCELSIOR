# Comic-Store--EXCELSIOR
The comic database project aims to create a comprehensive database that catalogs information about comic books and graphic novels for an Excelsior company. The domain of the project encompasses the world of comic stores, like various genres, publishers, creators, characters, customers inventory, and sales.

The intended application for this database is to provide a centralized resource for comic book store Excelsior to run and manage their store efficiently and for their customers to have a hassle-free experience.

The nature and scale of the data are vast and diverse, as the project covers comics from different years, countries, and publishers. The data includes metadata such as title, author, publisher, publication date, issue number, sales price sale date, quantity and quality of comics, and other relevant information. Additionally, the project also includes customer data.

Excelsior will be able to operate and maintain their company smoothly due to my design for the comic store database. The well-structured database will allow the store to handle day-to-day duties like inventory tracking, customer data management, and financial performance monitoring more efficiently. The store will have easy accessibility to data such as available comic stock, client purchase tendencies, the quantity of stock, and profit with this system in place. Excelsior will be able to make more informed decisions, enhance its operations, and eventually boost profitability as a result of this.
